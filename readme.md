## About the Project 

This project was created to make a weather forecast tracking application with a clean and simple interface. Oftentimes there are many weather applications that are cluttered with information that casual users do not necessarily require, and this application aims to deliver the most essential information in a straightforward and clear manner. 

## How to use the application? 

It’s easy! Just key in the location you are looking for in the search bar at the top and hit enter to get today’s temperature in degrees Celsius and weather forecast. An interesting feature here is that the background of the application changes with the temperature (hint: it changes when temperature is more or less than 20 degrees! Try it!) 

 

 

 

This application is built using: 

- React 

- OpenWeather API 

## Work In Progress 

More improvements to come -  

- Storing of favorite locations in a separate tab 

- Plan out and edit your travel itinerary, and track the weather at the same time
